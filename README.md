# Insight Data Engineering - Coding challenge

####Application for June 2015
####Applicant name: Ronak Nathani

The **src** directory containes a Python script which implements solution to the problem of **Word Count** and **Running Median**. The script reads all the text files in the directory **wc_input** and processes them alphabetically. **Word counts** and **Running median** for the text files are saved in **wc_result.txt** and **med_result.txt** which are saved in the directory **wc_output**. 

To execute the Python program, execute the **run.sh** script.

####Output format: 
Word couns in **wc_result.txt** are saved **alphabetically**, with a tab between the word and count, and each word separated by a newline. Running median in **med_result.txt** is saved as a double with only 1 digit after the decimal and medians are separated by a newline.

###Path for input and output directory:
Paths to the ipnut directory, which contains all text files, and path to to save results can be changed in the **run.sh** script. Both absolyte and relative paths will work fine.
